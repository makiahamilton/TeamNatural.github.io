# Team Natural
This is a website to bring information to black women with natural hair or those looking to transition to natural hair. The website will feature the background of natural hair and how it became such a big movement as of late, a tool to help women figure out their hair type so that they can find products that better suit their hair type, and personalized styling, product, and hairstyle tips and suggestions for each hair type.

## Technologies
We are using HTML, CSS, and possibly some Javascript and JQuery

## MVP Features
Our main goals are to get the background page, and the hair typing and tips page working and looking good.

## Features
### A page to assist people in finding out their hair type
###Indivdual, personalized pages for Type 3 and Type 4 hair and their respective sub-types with styling and hairstyle tips along with do's and don'ts and Youtube videos about dealing with each hair type for the visual learners.
###A page on Heat Styling, a common styling practice used by African American women incorrectly. They often put too much heat too often, or apply the heat ineffectively resulting in them having to apply heat over the same section more than once resulting in heat damage and breakage
###A page on Protective Styles which is a very good tool in a natural's arsenal because it allows their hair to be protected from the elements and given a chance to grow with little to no manipulation. An individual could grow a healthy, substantial amount of hair by using protective styles if they take care of it correctly
###A page on the history and background of natural hair and how the natural hair movement has ebbed and flowed

## Stretch Goals
One of our stretch goals is to use Javascdript or JQuery so that clicking one of the hair type links will take you to that section on their respective pages.
