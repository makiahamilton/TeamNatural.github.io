# Team Natural
This is a website to bring information to black women with natural hair or those looking to transition to natural hair. The website will feature the background of natural hair and how it became such a big movement as of late, a tool to help women figure out their hair type so that they can find products that better suit their hair type, and personalized styling, product, and hairstyle tips and suggestions for each hair type.

## Technologies
We are using HTML, CSS, and possibly some Javascript and JQuery

## MVP Features
Our main goals are to get the background page, and the hair typing and tips page working and looking good.

## Stretch Goals
One of our stretch goals is to use Javascript or JQuery so that clicking one of the hair type links will take you to that section on their respective pages. Another of our stretch goals is to have a Youtube or Instagram API that will cycle through hair tips given by fellow naturals. We think this will be useful because other black women with natural hair often have very good styling videos and product suggestions with videos of them using the products. Those videos and posts are very useful to those just starting out or even seasoned veterans looking for new tips and tricks.
